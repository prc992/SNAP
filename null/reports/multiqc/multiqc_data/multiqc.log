===========================
WARNING: Detected a Rosetta process, implying that MultiQC is running inside an x86_64 container, but hosted by Apple Silicon.

Static plot export uses Kaleido - a tool that is unstable under conflicting architectures, so MultiQC will not save static PNG/PDF/SVG plots to disk. If you still need those, please use a container with a compatible architecture. The official Dockerhub image multiqc/multiqc:latest is available for both platforms, and can be pulled with:

docker pull multiqc/multiqc:latest
